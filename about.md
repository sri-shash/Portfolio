## About Me
I’m Shash — QA lead, finance/trading analyst, and data-automation specialist.

I help teams save hours by automating Excel tasks, cleaning messy datasets, and turning chaos into clear reports. I also serve on the finance committee of a Vipassana trust, handling financial oversight and process improvement.

**Stack:** Python (pandas), Excel, CSV/JSON, simple APIs, Google Sheets.
