# About Me

Hi, I’m **Shash** 👋  

I help businesses and individuals automate their messy data so they can focus on **decisions, not spreadsheets**.  

With a background in **QA, finance, and trading analysis**, plus hands-on experience with **Python automation, Excel reporting, and data cleanup**, I bring efficiency and clarity to workflows that otherwise eat up hours.  

When I’m not wrangling data, you’ll find me exploring fitness, trading strategies, or Vipassana meditation.
