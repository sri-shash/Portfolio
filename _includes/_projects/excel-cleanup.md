## Problem
A finance team had **20,000+ rows** of messy Excel data with duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent formats.

## My Solution
- Python + Pandas pipeline
- Standardized dates/currency/locale
- Removed duplicates, flagged missing
- Output dashboard-ready file in under 2 minutes

## Impact
3 days â†’ 5 minutes. Consistent, repeatable, blissfully boring.
