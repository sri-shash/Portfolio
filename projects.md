# Projects

A few highlights from my work:

### ✅ Excel Cleanup & Automation
- Took a large messy Excel file with duplicates and errors.  
- Automated cleaning + formatting in Python.  
- Reduced processing time from **4 hours to 10 minutes**.

---

### ✅ Reporting Dashboard
- Built a custom dashboard that combined finance + operations data.  
- Allowed management to track KPIs in real-time.  

---

### ✅ Python Data QA Script
- Automated detection of missing values, inconsistent entries, and anomalies.  
- Saved a team 20+ hours a month in manual checks.
